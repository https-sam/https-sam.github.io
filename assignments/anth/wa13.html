      <h3>hi.</h3>
      <p>I am a Teaching Assistant Professor in the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder. I completed my PhD in Information Science, also at CU Boulder, working with Jed Brubaker and the Identity Lab. My research interests focus on understanding the experiences people have during life transitions and how those experiences are represented in sociotechnical systems. I am particularly interested in how people make decisions about the data that are left behind in the wake of a romantic relationship ending, and how those decisions contribute to the formation of post-break-up identities.</p>
      <p>I am concurrently an Adjunct Part-Time Faculty member in Penn State's College of Information Sciences and Technology, where I have taught through Penn State's World Campus program since 2016.</p>
      <p>For more information about my past and present professional activities, see my curriculum vitae. For more about me, have a look at the about page.</p>

      <h3>about me.</h3>
      <p>I come from a family of educators, and was afforded the opportunity to see different parts of the country while my father completed his PhD, post-doc, and got his first academic position. Because of my background, I knew early on I wanted to pursue a career in research and teaching. After a brief failed stint as an engineering student, I completed my B.S. and M.S. in Information Sciences and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University in 2015 and 2017, respectively. My M.S. was overseen by Lynette (Kvasny) Yarger. While at Penn State, I competed in track and field, specializing in the multi-event disciplines.</p>
      <p>Since moving to Colorado, I've leaned into the lifestyle you would expect a Coloradan have. I spend most of my free time riding or thinking about bikes and skis (depending on the season). I ride all disciplines on bikes year round, but train specifically for long XC-style mountain bike races like the Leadville 100 MTB . During the winter, I've confined myself to on-piste or sidecountry skiing, but I expect that to change within the next year or so. I have also continued my involvement in track and field as the high jump and multi-events coach at Boulder High School and a USATF Level 1 Coach.</p>
      <h3>about this site.</h3>
      <p>For a long time, I had a static website inspired primarily by The Personal Page by Naz Hamid at Weightshift. However, as I enter the last year of my doctoral work, I felt it was time to do something a bit more substantial. I've always been a bit of a minimalist when it comes to design. I was taken with Mor Naaman's personal website, but wanted the Jekyll functionality I had come to enjoy from working on the Identity Lab's site. So I combined the two (with substantial design tweaks), and here we are. You can find the repo for this particular design on my Github.</p>
